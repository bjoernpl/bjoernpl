## Björn Plüster - @bjoernpl

I am currently studying in the Intelligent Adaptive Systems Masters program at the [University of Hamburg](https://www.uni-hamburg.de/) and am interested in most things coding related. Currently I'm focussing on AI research, particularly regarding multimodal applications of the Transformer architecture.

### Projects
In my repositories you'll find some projects:
- [DiscoveredWeekly](https://github.com/bjoernpl/DiscoveredWeekly) contains the source code for my website [discoveredweekly.com](https://discoveredweekly.com) where users can log in with their Spotify account and every monday their new Discover Weekly playlist will get copied automatically, making sure no valuable song suggestions are ever lost.
- [Explainable OFA](https://explainable-ofa.ml/) is a demo created for a university project. In this, we vizualize the attention maps of a multimodal transformer model ([OFA](https://github.com/OFA-Sys/OFA)) in a VQA task to aid in the interpretation of the results. An extension of this is coming sometime in the future.
- [AutoObjectRemoval](https://github.com/bjoernpl/AutoObjectRemoval) is a combination of Instance Segmentation using
Detectron2, and Flow-Guided Video Completion to create a system which can automatically mask and remove objects
from videos.
- [VideoSilenceRemover](https://github.com/bjoernpl/VideoSilenceRemover) is a tool for automatically cutting segments of silence out of
a video. Created this tool for a friend to facilitate the boring parts of his job.
- [DirectoryStats](https://github.com/bjoernpl/DirectoryStats) is a python CLI for efficiently counting large amounts of
files and subdirectories. Needed this to keep track of directory size during creation of the dataset for my thesis project.
- [PaypalTransactionVisualizer](https://github.com/bjoernpl/PaypalTransactionVisualizer) is a Jupyter notebook
which shows you some interesting infos about your past spending with PayPal. This is a project I implemented mostly
to gain some insight on my own spending habits but also to practice using Jupyter and some interesting python features.
- [YoutubeHistoryVisualizer](https://github.com/bjoernpl/YoutubeHistoryVisualizer) is a notebook along a similar line
which shows you some stats regarding the Youtube videos you've used in the past. It works with data from Google Takeout.
- [ColorFlow](https://github.com/bjoernpl/ColorFlow) is an Android game written in Java, which was a cool side project.
The repo is not well maintained and used primarily as my own VCS. Check out the game in the 
[Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bnpgames.android.colorflow). This is a project I will
definitely come back to in the future and maybe rewrite in proper Kotlin.

### Experience
Due to my job at [SecSign Technologies](https://github.com/SecSign), university projects and some of my own learning,
I have experience in many areas and languages:

Python is by far my favorite language to work with. I use it whenever the project scope allows it. 
My experience includes PyTorch, Numpy and many other libraries.

Kotlin is my language of choice for Android development and is the language I probably have the most experience in.

Swift for iOS development including SwiftUI is a modern language that I don't have very much experience in but very 
much enjoy coding with. I am eager to learn more about it once I have the time.

Java is the language I, like many others, learned to code with but since switching to Kotlin for Android
development, I haven't used it much.

 p5.js is a Javascript library which makes coding simple graphics and interesting visuals very easy.

##### Others
- C++ for working with Arduinos. Mainly used for university projects.
- Some basic PHP, HTML, Javascript and CSS for creating some web plugins.
