AI researcher currently invested in German LLMs. Collaborating with LAION and focused on advancing european open-source AI research. Interested and experienced in large-scale distributed language model training and evaluation. Studying Intelligent Adaptive Systems (MSc.) at University of Hamburg.

### Recent Project
- **German LLM**: WIP. Current open-source LLMs suck at german. I'm working to fix that.
- **Vision-Language Explanations**: Transformer explainability is lacking but they are great at producing text. Why not have it explain it's own decisions? A large research project investigating natural language explanations for multimodal transformer applications. Currently under review. Arxiv preprint: https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04231
- [KOSMOS-1 Reimplimentation](https://github.com/bjoernpl/KOSMOS_reimplementation): The KOSMOS-1 paper (multimodal foundation model) was super interesting to me at the time but no code to be found anywhere. This is a very rudimentary reimplementation of the core aspects.
- [Tagesschau](https://github.com/bjoernpl/tagesschau): Simple scrape of Tagesschau news articles.

### Older Projects
In my repositories you'll find some projects:
- [DiscoveredWeekly](https://github.com/bjoernpl/DiscoveredWeekly) contains the source code for my website [discoveredweekly.com](https://discoveredweekly.com) where users can log in with their Spotify account and every monday their new Discover Weekly playlist will get copied automatically, making sure no valuable song suggestions are ever lost.
- [AutoObjectRemoval](https://github.com/bjoernpl/AutoObjectRemoval) is a combination of Instance Segmentation using
Detectron2, and Flow-Guided Video Completion to create a system which can automatically mask and remove objects
from videos.
- [VideoSilenceRemover](https://github.com/bjoernpl/VideoSilenceRemover) is a tool for automatically cutting segments of silence out of
a video. Created this tool for a friend to facilitate the boring parts of his job.
- [DirectoryStats](https://github.com/bjoernpl/DirectoryStats) is a python CLI for efficiently counting large amounts of
files and subdirectories. Needed this to keep track of directory size during creation of the dataset for my thesis project.
- [PaypalTransactionVisualizer](https://github.com/bjoernpl/PaypalTransactionVisualizer) is a Jupyter notebook
which shows you some interesting infos about your past spending with PayPal. This is a project I implemented mostly
to gain some insight on my own spending habits but also to practice using Jupyter and some interesting python features.
- [YoutubeHistoryVisualizer](https://github.com/bjoernpl/YoutubeHistoryVisualizer) is a notebook along a similar line
which shows you some stats regarding the Youtube videos you've used in the past. It works with data from Google Takeout.
- [ColorFlow](https://github.com/bjoernpl/ColorFlow) is an Android game written in Java, which was a cool side project.
The repo is not well maintained and used primarily as my own VCS. Check out the game in the 
[Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bnpgames.android.colorflow).
