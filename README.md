## Björn Plüster - @bjoernpl

I'm a computer science student at [University of Hamburg](https://www.uni-hamburg.de/) and am interested in all
things related to coding. 

### Experience and past projects
In my repositories you'll find some small projects:
- [PaypalTransactionVisualizer](https://github.com/bjoernpl/PaypalTransactionVisualizer) is a Jupyter notebook
which shows you some interesting infos about your past spending with PayPal. This is a project I implemented mostly
to gain some insight on my own spending habits but also to practice using Jupyter and some interesting python features.
- [YoutubeHistoryVisualizer](https://github.com/bjoernpl/YoutubeHistoryVisualizer) is a notebook along a similar line
which shows you some stats regarding the Youtube videos you've used in the past. It works with data from Google Takeout.
- [ColorFlow](https://github.com/bjoernpl/ColorFlow) is an Android game written in Java, which was a cool side project.
The repo is not well maintained and used primarily as my own VCS. Check out the game in the 
[Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bnpgames.android.colorflow). This is a project I will
definitely come back to in the future and maybe rewrite in proper Kotlin.

Due to my job at [SecSign Technologies](https://github.com/SecSign), university projects and some of my own learning,
I have experience in many areas and languages:

Python is by far my favorite language to work with. I use it whenever the project scope allows it. 
My experience includes TensorFlow, PyTorch and many other libraries.

Kotlin is my language of choice for Android development and is the language I probably have the most experience in.

Swift for iOS development including SwiftUI is a modern language that I don't have very much experience in but very 
much enjoy coding with. I am eager to learn more about it once I have the time.

Java is the language I, like many others, learned to code with but since switching to Kotlin for Android
development, I haven't used it much.

 p5.js is a Javascript library which makes coding simple graphics and interesting visuals very easy. Check out some of my 
<a href="https://editor.p5js.org/code/sketches">sketches</a>.

##### Others
- C++ for working with Arduinos. Mainly used for university projects.
- Some basic PHP, HTML, Javascript and CSS for creating some web plugins.

### Future plans
I will soon be starting on my bachelor's thesis, where I will be using PyTorch to implement a
model for speech synthesis which will approximate a persons voice using a face embedding. After completing
this, I plan on gaining some experience by working on some open source projects.
